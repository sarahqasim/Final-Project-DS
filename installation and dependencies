Importing libraries:
-	Numpy and pandas for data processing and manipulation
-	Matplotlib and seaborn for visualisation
-	We used the models and layers subpackages from Keras to import the Sequential model and Conv2D, MaxPool2D, Flatten, Dense and Dropout layers for building the neural network.

Importing Dataset
-	The mnist train and test zip files were imported from Kaggle.
-	The files were uploaded on Google Collab file, unzipped using the 
-	!unzip method which was then stored in the cloud along with the zipped versions. These files were then read as train_df and test_df using pandasâ€™ read_csv function.
